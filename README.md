10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

1. Installing Git and VS Code
Install Git: Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
Install VS Code: Download and install Visual Studio Code from code.visualstudio.com.
2. Setting Up Git in VS Code
Open VS Code.
Go to the Source Control view by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
If Git is installed, VS Code will automatically detect it.
3. Initializing a Repository
Open your project folder in VS Code.
In the Source Control view, you will see an option to "Initialize Repository" if you are not already in a Git repository.
Click "Initialize Repository". This will create a .git folder in your project directory, which means your folder is now a Git repository.
4. Making Changes and Committing
Stage Changes: After modifying your files, go to the Source Control view. You will see a list of changed files. To stage changes, click the "+" icon next to the files you want to stage.
Write a Commit Message: After staging your changes, write a commit message in the text box above the list of changes.
Commit Changes: Click the checkmark icon or press Ctrl+Enter to commit the changes.
5. Connecting to GitHub
If you haven't already, create an account on GitHub.
Create a new repository on GitHub. Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo.git).
Back in VS Code, open a terminal by selecting Terminal > New Terminal.
Add the remote repository by executing the command:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
To verify the remote has been added, use:
bash
Copy code
git remote -v
6. Pushing Changes to GitHub
Once you have committed your changes locally, you need to push them to GitHub. In the terminal, execute:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
If your default branch is master, replace main with master.
7. Making Subsequent Changes
Repeat the process of staging, committing, and pushing changes as you continue to work on your project.
For subsequent pushes, you can simply use:
bash
Copy code
git push
8. Pulling Changes from GitHub
To fetch and merge changes from GitHub (if you are collaborating with others), you can pull changes using:
bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Adjust main to your default branch name if necessary.
9. Using Git Features in VS Code
VS Code provides various Git-related features, including viewing commit history, managing branches, and resolving merge conflicts. Explore these features in the Source Control view and through the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

 Submission Guidelines:
